## Biography

I am currently a Post-doctoral Fellow at the Centre for Centre for Transformative Garment Production (TransGP) in Hong Kong. Prior to joining TransGP, I obtained my PhD in **Informatics** from the University of Edinburgh, where I was supervised by [**Prof. Taku Komura**](https://www.cs.hku.hk/index.php/people/academic-staff/taku). I also hold an MSc in **Artificial Intelligence** from the University of Edinburgh, which provided me with a strong foundation in machine learning and computational techniques.

My research focuses on **physics-based simulation** and **computational modeling**, with a specialization in simulating complex physical phenomena such as fracture mechanics, deformable bodies, differentiable simulation, machine learning, and cloth dynamics. I am particularly passionate about bridging the gap between theoretical models and real-world applications by leveraging advanced numerical methods, including the Material Point Method (MPM) and the Finite Element Method (FEM).

My work aims to create highly realistic simulations that capture the intricate details of real-world physics, enabling better insights into material behavior and advancing applications in fields such as virtual garment production, interactive animation, and game physics systems. I am committed to pushing the boundaries of realism in simulations to solve challenging problems and contribute to innovative technologies.

## Interest

I am a passionate tennis enthusiast. Over the past ten years, I have spent more than 2,000 hours on the tennis court. For me, there’s nothing more satisfying than the sharp, crisp sound of a ball striking the center of the racket. It helps me overcome stress, exhaustion, and moments of hardship. My favorite player, without a doubt, is Novak Djokovic.
